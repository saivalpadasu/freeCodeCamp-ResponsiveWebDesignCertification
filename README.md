#### I already had the knowledge of HTML CSS and basic JavaScript for creating basic front-end websites which I gained mostly through online tutorials and during my bachelors but with the start of this particular certification I was again brushed up with all the topics related to HTML and CSS and I was also introduced to several new concepts that I was absolutely unfamiliar with, such as Advanced CSS Pseudo Selectors and CSS Animation. At the end of each module a website needs to build from scratch as the part of the certification completion. A total of five website were built by me during the entirety of the certification.
- #### Survey Form: Here, I've developed a simple feedback form to learn about website issues that may be fixed to make the website more appealing.
- #### Tribute Page: Here, I've developed a page as a tribute to Chester Bennington who was a lead singer in a band called Linkpark and my all time favourite singer. This pages also includes a few of the famous albums released by the band and their publish years.
- #### Technical Documentation: Here, I've created a page with a navigation bar that provides a preliminary understanding of the semantics and syntax of Python programming languages. The topics are easier to understand because I have included code snippets also for specific topics.
- #### Product Landing Page: I've made a landing page for a water bottle with built-in filtration. This page has three sections: the price, usage instructions (which lead to a YouTube video), and information on why you should buy the bottle.
- #### Personal Portfolio: This gives a brief intro about myself and contact details to get in touch with me and also lists all the projects that I have done so far during freeCodeCamp Certifications.
